# react-native-web-static-image
An attempt to display a static image from react-native-web. The app was created by following the steps at [this article](https://medium.com/@aureliomerenda/create-a-native-web-app-with-react-native-web-419acac86b82), then I `yarn add customize-cra react-app-rewired` using info from [this article](https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2020-10-24-adding-react-native-web/) so that I might apply the `url-loader` webpack rule mentioned in [react-native-web issue #1497](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/1497) to get a static image to load using `<image source={require(...)}>`
